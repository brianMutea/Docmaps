# Building DocMaps with Next.js 14

In this post, we'll explore the technical architecture of DocMaps and how we leverage Next.js 14's App Router to build a fast, scalable documentation platform.

## Technology Stack

DocMaps is built with:

- **Next.js 14** with App Router
- **React Flow** for interactive diagrams
- **Supabase** for backend and authentication
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **TypeScript** for type safety

## Why Next.js 14?

Next.js 14 provides several key benefits:

### Server Components

We use React Server Components to fetch data on the server, reducing client-side JavaScript and improving performance.

### App Router

The new App Router provides better routing, layouts, and data fetching patterns that make our code more maintainable.

### Image Optimization

Next.js automatically optimizes images, which is crucial for documentation with many diagrams and screenshots.

## Architecture Decisions

### Monorepo Structure

We use Turborepo to manage our monorepo with separate apps for the editor and viewer, plus shared packages for common functionality.

### Database Design

Our PostgreSQL database uses JSONB columns for flexible node and edge data, allowing us to support various node types without schema migrations.

## Performance Optimizations

We've implemented several optimizations:

- Static generation for public maps
- Incremental Static Regeneration for updates
- Code splitting for the editor
- Lazy loading for heavy components

## Conclusion

Next.js 14 has been an excellent choice for building DocMaps. The combination of Server Components, App Router, and built-in optimizations has allowed us to create a fast, maintainable platform.
