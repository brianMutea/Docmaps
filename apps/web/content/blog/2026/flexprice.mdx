# Flexprice and the era of usage-based pricing for AI products

As AI products become more common, teams building them face a growing pain point that traditional subscription 
billing systems were never designed to solve — tracking and charging for what users actually consume. AI workflows 
often involve quantifying tokens used, compute time, API calls, or model inference counts, and these metrics vary widely 
from session to session. Companies that try to stitch together subscription billing with custom usage tracking often end up 
with brittle logic and expensive technical debt. Flexprice approaches this problem by offering a unified platform for **usage metering**, **pricing**, credits, and billing 
that is built to handle the unpredictable consumption patterns of AI-driven products. It is explicitly designed to let developers focus on product rather than infrastructure.
In this system, usage events are the fundamental input. Developers instrument their application to send usage data via SDKs or APIs, and Flexprice aggregates and tracks these 
in real time so pricing and billing can reflect actual customer activity. This real-time event ingestion is the foundation for every other capability in the platform.
